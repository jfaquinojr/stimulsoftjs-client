# StimulsoftClient Test

This project was created to show that the library stimulsoft-reports-js does not work out of the box.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.1.

Then I added the stimulsoft-reports-js library

    yarn add stimulsoft-reports-js


Then I showed the designer by simplifying some of the stuff from their [docs](https://www.stimulsoft.com/en/documentation/online/programming-manual/reports_js_running_designer.htm).

see `app.component`.


## Check it out

    $ git clone https://github.com/jfaquinojr/stimulsoftjs-client.git  
    $ cd stimulsoftjs-client  
    $ yarn  
    $ ng serve

ERROR!

I might have missed something along the way. If you know what that is, please file an issue or submit a PR.

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks.
